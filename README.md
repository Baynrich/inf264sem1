Run decision.tree.py for a simple test that gives a run of all the models, and prints the result of the best one in training,
and what result that tree has after testing. It also stores said best model in the best_tree variable if further testing
 is wanted. New trees can be made in decision.tree.py with my_tree.Tree(), and then Tree.createTree(X,y...).
 Tree.accuracy() gives a score < 1 and > 0 of the accuracy of the model. Tree.predict() takes a single set of values and
  returns  its label.
